### Requirements
* Must use a MySQL database hosted in AWS RDS, and use stored procedures
    * Should have tables for Categories, Products, Purchases, and PurchasesProducts
    * Categories
        * id int AI
        * name varchar(50)
    * Products
        * id int AI
        * categoryid int FK for Categories id, cascade update, set null on delete
        * title varchar(50)
        * description varchar(255)
        * price decimal(5,2)
        * imageurl varchar(500)
    * Purchases
        * id int AI
        * price decimal(5,2)
        * stripetransactionid varchar(100)
    * PurchasesProducts
        * productid int FK for Product id, cascade update, cascade on delete
        * purchaseid int FK for Purchase id, cascade update, cascade on delete
* Must use Express and NodeJS, hosted in AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* Must use prerender.io
* Must use Stripe for card processing
* Must use Sendgrid or Mailgun for email sending
* Must be responsive (look good on mobile and desktop)
    * Bootstrap's Grid System will be very helpful
    * You can find standalone grid systems if you don't want to use Bootstrap

### Images
* You will be given product images
    * You can save these into a folder named images in your client folder
    * For a file called waterbottle.png in the images folder, the product in the database should have an imageurl value of '/images/waterbottle.png'
* You can use mustache in the src of an image tag to bind to the imageurl of the product
    * You may want to use a background-image instead

### Other Hints
* Think about $routeProvider and front-end route parameters to see whether you need separate views/controllers for apparel and misc or not
